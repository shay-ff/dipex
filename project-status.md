# Dipex Project Status Report

## Overview
Dipex is an expense tracking app that uses screenshot-based OCR to capture UPI payment confirmations. This document outlines the current implementation status versus the planned features from the product specification.

## Recent engineering updates (2025-10-06)

Summary of recent changes made during the debugging and cleanup session:

- Fixed OCR endpoint parameter handling: the `/api/v1/ocr/extract-and-save` endpoint now expects a JSON body with `{"user_id": <id>}` rather than a query parameter. A request Pydantic model (`OCRRequest`) was added.
- Replaced ad-hoc `print()` debug statements in `backend/app/api/v1/ocr.py` with a proper logger (module-level `logging`), and removed noisy console prints. This reduces accidental sensitive output in logs.
- Added `.env.example` with placeholder values so contributors know which environment variables to set without committing secrets.
- Verified `.gitignore` includes `.env` so the real credential file is not tracked by git.
- Fixed `backend/core/config.py` (Pydantic settings) to rely on environment values and sensible defaults; created a local `.env` for development only (not committed).
- Installed Python dependencies into a virtual environment and validated the backend can connect to the local Postgres Docker container and query `users` (confirmed user id=1 exists).

Files changed during the session (high level):
- `backend/app/api/v1/ocr.py` — request model added, debug prints removed, logging introduced.
- `.env.example` — new file with placeholders for required environment variables.
- `backend/core/config.py` — settings cleaned up for safer usage with `.env`.

Verification performed:
- Confirmed the database (Postgres Docker) is running and accessible from the backend. Queried `users` table and verified a record exists.
- Started the FastAPI server and exercised the OCR endpoint using a JSON POST body (curl) to confirm behavior.

Notes & follow-ups (recommended before pushing publicly):
- Do not commit your local `.env` — it contains credentials. If those values are real, rotate the credentials before publishing or sharing the repository.
- Consider converting remaining `print()` calls in utility scripts to logging (I left prints in test/init utilities intentionally; let me know if you want them converted).
- Add a small section to `SETUP_GUIDE.md` or `README.md` describing how to copy `.env.example` -> `.env`, start the local Postgres container, create the virtualenv, and run the server.
- Add database migrations (Alembic) or a documented migration strategy. Currently models exist but migration history is not tracked.
- Add basic automated tests and a CI workflow that runs lint, tests, and a secret-scan on pull requests.

   - Category management
   - Expense listing and filtering

### Phase 2: Mobile App Foundation (Weeks 3-4)
1. **React Native Setup**
   - Project initialization
   - Navigation structure
   - Basic UI components

2. **Core Screens**
   - Authentication screens
   - Expense upload screen
   - Expense list screen

### Phase 3: Smart Features (Weeks 5-6)
1. **Auto-Categorization**
   - Vendor database setup
   - Basic ML model for categorization
   - User feedback system

2. **Budget Management**
   - Budget setting functionality

## Conclusion

The project has a solid foundation with well-defined models and basic API structure, but significant work remains to achieve the vision outlined in the planning document. The core OCR functionality exists in skeleton form but needs real implementation. The mobile app hasn't been started, which is critical for user adoption.

**Current Completion**: ~15% of planned features
**Estimated Time to MVP**: 6-8 weeks with focused development
**Biggest Risks**: OCR accuracy, mobile app development complexity, user adoption without real functionality
