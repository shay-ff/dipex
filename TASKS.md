# Starter Tasks

Welcome new contributors! Here are a few small tasks to get you familiar with the codebase.

## Good first issues
- [ ] Add unit tests for `backend/services/ocr_services.py` parsing logic
- [ ] Add CI workflow that runs `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt` and `pytest`
- [ ] Improve README with architecture diagram (plantuml or ascii)
- [ ] Convert remaining `print()` calls in utility scripts to `logging` (I converted several already)

## Starter guidance
- Create a branch named `starter/<your-name>-<task>` and open a PR when ready.
- Ask for a reviewer and mention any questions in the PR description.
